Welcome to the 20-player, open-world Pokémon pirate epic developed on a Pentium 4405U (because efficiency is king).
The Merit System

Merit Meter: Required for ship-side data collection.
Edible Data: Cook Merit into Smoothies, Pancakes, and the legendary 50 MB Merit Lobster (for 2 weeks of Infinite Luck).
20-Player Servers: Form an armada or sail solo.
The Mascot: An orange eShop Bag that speaks in Stellar Binary.
Current High-Priority Bug: Little Timmy (An 8 GB arsonist who keeps deleting dungeons).
Hardware Goals
Primarily Windows 11 and Android.
Optimised for the Nintendo Switch 2.
Targeting "More Efficient than Rockstar" performance.
